# Stock-Trading-Algorithm
An algorithm that replicates the analysis I perform to trade stocks so that I can replicate it for many securities, or to find the best securities to purchase

The algorithm automates the creation of support and resistance lines with regression and heuristics to guide a trader whether the stock is a buy or sell.
The algorithm can be looped on many securities to find the best secturities to trade

Still needs more work to be done with parameter tuning, learning more about the market and a lot more...
